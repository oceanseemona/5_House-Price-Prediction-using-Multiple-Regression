Practical implementation on Multiple Regression Analysis

OBJECTIVE:

Our objective is to predict house prices and measure prediction error using multiple regression. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable.

DATA:

The Real Estate Valuation Dataset used in this project is included as Real estate valuation data set.csv
Five features (X1 to X5) has been taken as parameters. 

X1 - house age
X2 - distance to the nearest MRT station
X3 - number of convenience stores
X4 - latitude
X5 - longitude

And the Actual Value of House prices is given as Y.

INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

> NumPy
command prompt: pip install numpy

> Pandas
command prompt: pip install pandas

> Matplotlib
command prompt: pip install matplotlib

> Jupyter Notebook
command prompt: pip install jupyter

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, which already has the above packages.

OUTPUT:

> The actual Y values and predicted values has been plotted
> Error table for multiple regression has been shown
> Computed Mean Absolute Error
